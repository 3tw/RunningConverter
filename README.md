# RunningConverter

My first app was created using PyCharm and QT Designer as an exercise to combine some basic knowledge of python with a GUI. It calculates pace, time or distance (depending on which two varaibles the user decides to fill-in). For example, it returns the pace one has to maintain in order to run a marathon in 2 hours.
